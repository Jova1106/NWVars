# NWVars Instructions

Edit the InitNetworkVars table in lua/nwvars/server/server_priority/init.lua to initialize any variables that you want to use. Uninitialized variables won't be recognized.

These functions are designed to allow networked variables to be set on the server, and received on the client.
